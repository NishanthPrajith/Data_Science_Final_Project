# California Wilfire Detection Data Science Project 
CSC 46000 Introduction to Data Science Final Project

In this project we are gonna look at historical wildfire data to analyze which places in California are under fire threat and how deadly they can get by areas. We will build a dataset for training from two different data sources: wildfire data and weather api to detect wildfire before they occur.
